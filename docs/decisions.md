  Decision: Show initials instead of Google's profile picture on owner avatars (#149)
  Why: The profile API needs a stable fallback while Google does not always supply a name, and an avatar is not worth another network dependency or privacy surface now. Initials come from the name (or the email's local part) on the server, so both clients render the same thing without fetching anything. If a picture is added later, store it locally rather than hotlinking Google's URL, which can expire and leaks the owner's browsing to the image host.

  Decision: Identify an owner by provider plus stable subject, and use a verified email only as a fallback link (#156)
  Why: One owner will have Google, email-code, Apple and Microsoft methods, and two failure modes have to be impossible: one person getting two owners, and one person inheriting another person's owner because an address moved. Therefore a returning subject always signs in as its own owner; an email can find an owner only when the provider guarantees the claim (Google today, our own code later) and the subject is not already linked to a different owner for that provider; a provider with an unverified email claim creates a separate owner. A live session can always attach another method because it already proves control of the owner, but the last method cannot be unlinked. The policy lives in `lib/authLinking.ts` and is called by both the NextAuth callback and the mobile exchange, instead of relying on NextAuth's provider-specific email linking. `auth_accounts` records the method's own email, when it was added and last used; no provider tokens are stored. No support override exists in code, and merging two owners stays an operator task.

  Decision: Send transactional email through Resend's HTTP API behind a transport interface, with a fake outbox for tests and the dev stack (#155)
  Why: Options checked 2026-10-30: Resend (free 3,000/month with 100/day on 3 domains; paid from $20/month for 50,000 — https://resend.com/pricing), Postmark (free 100/month; paid from $15/month for 10,000 — https://postmarkapp.com/pricing), Amazon SES (Essentials from $0.16 per 1,000 — https://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/), and Cloudflare Email Service (Email Sending is beta and needs Workers Paid; 3,000/month included then $0.35 per 1,000 — https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/platform/pricing/). All four support a verified own domain with SPF, DKIM and DMARC; the pilot's Cloudflare Tunnel does not make Cloudflare the default sender. Resend has the smallest setup and a free tier large enough for the pilot, documents a plain `text` field, an Idempotency-Key and automatic hard-bounce suppression, and needs only `fetch` (no new dependency). SES is cheapest at volume but needs AWS IAM and production-access approval; Postmark's 100-message free tier is too small to re-send codes; Cloudflare sending is still beta. Plain SMTP to a mailbox provider was rejected because it adds credential and connection management without removing the provider, and every candidate already offers SMTP later if needed. Resend will not send from a shared domain to arbitrary recipients, so #90's hostname must resolve to a domain the owner controls; one test to the account owner's own address is possible before DNS is ready. `lib/email.ts` uses the fake transport outside production (in-memory outbox plus one log line so the dev can read the code) and Resend in production once `EMAIL_FROM` and `RESEND_API_KEY` are set; a missing setting fails closed with `EmailError` (`email_unavailable`), and tests never reach the network. Messages are plain text first (one-time code now, reset link later), with no HTML, tracking pixels, review text or secrets in real-transport logs, and a process-local throttle limits both recipient and sender. Permanent bounces go to Resend's suppression list; complaint webhooks and DNS setup are owner/follow-up work. The owner creates the Resend account and domain records, and no live send was run in this PR, so #152's email issues stay blocked until that test is recorded.

  Decision: Link an email sign-in to an existing owner only when the verified address matches, and never merge two owners (#152, #156)
  Why: `auth_accounts` already keys identity on provider plus stable subject id. The email method uses the normalised address as its subject; a code proves control of that mailbox, so an owner already known by that address keeps one owner and gains a method, while a different address always gets a new owner. Google owners keep their rows and businesses unchanged. The residual risk that a reassigned address can recover the owner it was registered to is inherent in passwordless email and is documented in `docs/auth.md` instead of being hidden behind an automatic merge.

- Date: 2026-10-28
  Decision: Allow OpenRouter as the caption provider, with the model supplied only by `OPENROUTER_MODEL`
  Why: The pilot has no OpenAI or Anthropic key and wants to start on OpenRouter's free models. It speaks the OpenAI chat-completions shape, so it is a second branch inside the existing `fetch` caller with no new dependency. The model is a required setting with no default because free model ids change and a guessed id would fail in production; without it nothing is sent. OpenAI keeps priority when both keys are set, so existing deployments are unchanged. Free models are rate limited and may log prompts (reviewer quotes), so use real customer reviews only after checking the chosen model's data policy.

- Date: 2026-10-27
  Decision: Send "posts ready" notifications through the Expo push HTTP API with `fetch`, not `expo-server-sdk`, and record each send in `push_deliveries` (#88)
  Why: Only two endpoints (send, getReceipts) are needed, so a plain, timeout-bounded `fetch` avoids a new dependency. A unique `(business_id, period_start, token)` delivery row makes one send per device per weekly period survive worker restarts; attempts are capped at three. Tokens reported as `DeviceNotRegistered` (by ticket or receipt) are deleted. Payloads carry only a count, the business name and a `praiseloop://queue` deep link. The transport is injectable so tests never call Expo.

- Date: 2026-10-26
  Decision: Accept hashed bearer sessions for the native app alongside NextAuth cookies (#80)
  Why: Native apps send neither cookies nor a matching Origin. `auth_sessions` gains a `kind` (`web` or `mobile`) and `created_at` so mobile sessions can slide for 30 days under a 90-day absolute cap without changing the web's eight-hour sessions. Both credentials in one request are rejected, and origin checks stay for cookie writes where CSRF applies. One guard still enforces ownership, upload size and limits for every route.

- Date: 2026-10-26
  Decision: Publish `linux/amd64` web and worker images to GHCR from CI (#102)
  Why: The pilot server and a future VPS both run x86-64, so building and pushing a single platform keeps the pipeline fast; add `linux/arm64` only if an ARM host is planned. PRs build without pushing so Dockerfile breakage is caught in review, and master pushes only after `verify` passes using the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write`. Images contain no secrets; runtime configuration stays in the environment. Package visibility remains an owner decision before #90 goes live (private needs a `read:packages` token to pull).

  Decision: Use Expo SDK 58, Expo Router and Jest/`jest-expo` for the app in `mobile/` (#84)
  Why: One TypeScript codebase covers iOS and Android while the web dependencies and Docker build stay unchanged (`mobile` is excluded from the root tsconfig, ESLint and `.dockerignore`). Expo Router gives file-based navigation for the queue, sign-in and update screens. Jest with the Expo preset runs in CI without a device or EAS account; EAS Build is optional and local builds also work. The bundle ID/package name is a placeholder until the owner confirms it in #91.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: Use a consented manual observation ledger and offline pilot report for #47
  Why: Current draft status/updated_at cannot reconstruct approval edits or session history. Explicit observations preserve unknown values, exclude synthetic businesses and avoid collecting review text or adding an unauthenticated report endpoint. No analytics platform or new dependency; human pilot outcomes remain unverified.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Use lightweight markdown docs for alignment
  Why: Fast to edit, easy to review, low process overhead. Keeps intent, architecture, and workflow explicit without heavy tooling.

- Date: 2026-10-14
  Decision: Refresh dependencies, Docker, and build tooling to a supported baseline (issue #48)
  Why: Reproducible installs (npm ci + lockfile), real ESLint, multi-stage Docker builds with healthchecks, Node 22 baseline, CI. Upgrades stayed within current major versions (Next 15, React 19, TypeScript 5); Next 16 / TypeScript 7 major upgrades are deferred. Redis/BullMQ queue remains planned — the worker stays a timer loop until #41.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Require explicit decision logging for architectural changes
  Why: Prevent re-litigating the same choices every week and reduce AI-driven drift in architecture over time.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Build as a SaaS web application (not a library/framework)
  Why: The product is a revenue-generating automation tool for local businesses. It requires onboarding, dashboards, approval flows, and scheduling — not just reusable code.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Use Node.js + TypeScript + Next.js
  Why: Strong ecosystem for API integrations, background jobs, and rapid product iteration. Type safety helps maintain architectural discipline as the codebase grows. Next.js supports both UI and API in one deployable unit.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Use Postgres as primary datastore
  Why: Relational model fits businesses, reviews, drafts, and scheduling states well. Strong consistency guarantees and mature tooling. Avoid premature NoSQL complexity.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Use Redis + BullMQ for background jobs
  Why: Review ingestion, quote extraction, image rendering, and scheduling are asynchronous tasks. A job queue ensures retries, observability, and reliability.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Deploy MVP via Docker on existing VPS
  Why: Lowest cost, full control, fast iteration. Infrastructure simplicity outweighs managed-service benefits at early stage.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Scheduler-first publishing strategy
  Why: Direct platform integrations (Instagram, X, Facebook, etc.) are complex and policy-heavy. Integrating with a scheduler (e.g., Buffer) reduces integration surface area and accelerates MVP delivery.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: Human-in-the-loop approval required for MVP
  Why: Protect brand voice and reduce risk. Auto-posting introduces reputational and legal risk. Manual approval builds trust and reduces AI hallucination exposure.

- Date: 2026-02-27
  Decision: PR-only development workflow (no direct pushes to main)
  Why: Prevent accidental architecture drift or destructive changes from AI agent. Maintain human oversight and review discipline.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: Render quote cards with Sharp's Pango text backend and DejaVu fonts (#8).
  Why: Actual glyph rasterization and measured wrapping replace unsupported SVG foreignObject layout. Runtime containers install the same font family; bounded embedded raster logos eliminate remote fetching and its SSRF risk. No text is silently shortened.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: Store quote-card-v1 options alongside existing brand colors (#26).
  Why: One typed template and two text sizes need no template framework. The sample preview uses the production renderer without persisting draft assets; default migration preserves colors and existing generated images.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: Enforce review identity in Postgres and preserve historical duplicates (#45).
  Why: Concurrent imports need a unique constraint, not check-then-insert. Normalize NFKC/case/whitespace and UTC milliseconds only for identity; retain original wording. Keep duplicate rows and their draft references under legacy keys, excluding them from new selection. Stable source IDs take precedence over imperfect manual fingerprints.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: NextAuth GitHub login with revocable database sessions and explicit legacy claims (#42). Superseded by the 2026-10-18 Google sign-in decision below; sessions/claims unchanged.
  Why: A maintained OAuth implementation handles sign-in/CSRF cookies. The minimal adapter stores no provider tokens and hashes session tokens. Shared server guards authorize every API family; DB counters persist generation limits. Media moves outside public with legacy URL denial. No password database, team roles or production provider setup.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: BullMQ delivery with a Postgres generation outbox, weekly reservations and renewable claims (#43).
  Why: Transactional business locks enforce quotas alongside draft uniqueness, while BullMQ provides the documented durable queue. An outbox recovers Redis loss without creating replacement drafts. Persisted stages bound redundant paid calls; retries and daily owner counters cap exposure.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: Serialize draft edits with revisions, transactional policy and append-only audit events (#44).
  Why: Every mutation shares ownership/lifecycle checks and a transaction context; stale revisions fail instead of overwriting edits. Approval decodes the persisted PNG. Rendering uses content-addressed filenames so approved artifacts cannot change in place. Chromium browser checks use playwright-core with an explicitly installed browser, never paid providers.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: Keep #29 blocked until owner Buffer access and a permitted live test are available.
  Why: Official GraphQL/OAuth-PKCE, scheduling/media and rate-limit interfaces are documented in integrations.md with dated references. No configured account/channel, encryption key or public media origin is available. Retire false stub success and content logging; no alternative provider, scraping or unverified live success is substituted.

- Date: 2026-10-15
  Decision: Keep Google sync #46 blocked at its access/reuse-policy feasibility gate.
  Why: Dated official prerequisites, OAuth/review contracts and policy references are captured in integrations.md. No approved project or permitted live location is configured, and temporary storage/manipulation rules need clarification for social reuse before adding a connector. Owner approval cannot substitute for provider access or policy resolution; no scraping/mock success.

- Date: 2026-10-18
  Decision: Use Google instead of GitHub as the owner OAuth provider (#76).
  Why: Pilot customers are small-business owners who rarely have GitHub accounts but usually have Google, often the account behind their Business Profile. Only openid/email/profile are requested, so no sensitive-scope verification is needed. Adapter, hashed database sessions, token discarding and ownership guards are unchanged. No GitHub app or real owners existed, so no account migration.

- Date: 2026-10-26
  Decision: Go mobile-first: an Expo app for owners on top of the existing server (#79, docs/mobile-plan.md)
  Why: Owners approve on their phones, not laptops, and a push notification is what brings them back weekly. Keeping the Next.js/Postgres/worker server avoids a rewrite; the app is a thin client over the same API and ownership guard. Expo gives one TypeScript codebase for iOS and Android. The app lives in `mobile/` as a separate package so web dependencies and builds are unaffected.

- Date: 2026-10-26
  Decision: Share sheet first; scheduler integration (#29) becomes a later paid feature (#79)
  Why: #29 is blocked on provider access, credentials and public media. The phone's share sheet lets the owner post the approved image and caption now, with media kept private. A new `shared` status records owner-reported posting and is never presented as verified publication. Approval stays required.

- Date: 2026-10-26
  Decision: Start hosting on the home server behind a Cloudflare Tunnel; move to a small VPS for paying customers (#79)
  Why: The pilot should cost about $0. The same Docker Compose stack runs in both places, and the app uses one HTTPS URL, so moving is a DNS change. Backups off the machine are required in both stages.

- Date: 2026-10-26
  Decision: Monetize through server-enforced plans (free/pro) unlocked by app-store subscriptions (#79)
  Why: AI captions, review sync, AI review replies and more posts per week are worth paying for, while CSV import and one weekly post keep a free tier. Entitlements live on the server so the app can't unlock features itself. The billing provider (for example RevenueCat) is chosen and stubbed in its own issue, as CONTRIBUTING.md requires.

- Date: 2026-10-26
  Decision: Store one plan per owner and enforce entitlements on the server (#94)
  Why: A plan per business could not enforce "more than one business", and store subscriptions attach to an owner anyway. One `owner_plans` row with source and expiry keeps upgrades simple; every owned business inherits the limits. Weekly targets are capped inside the generation lock, the free watermark is part of the deterministic render, and business creation is serialized per owner. Expired plans fall back to free without deleting the record, and `owner_plan_events` records every operator or future billing change.

- Date: 2026-10-27
  Decision: Verify Google ID tokens with `jose` 6.2.13 (#81)
  Why: Verification needs JWKS fetching and caching, RS256 signature, issuer, audience and expiry checks. `jose` does all of it with no dependencies and supports local key sets for fixture tests. `google-auth-library` pulls in a much larger tree for the same job.

- Date: 2026-10-27
  Decision: Land the Buffer adapter and credential encryption behind the still-closed scheduler gate (#29, partial).
  Why: These are safe without provider access: mocked-fetch contract tests cover auth, 429, timeout-after-acceptance (ambiguous, never resubmitted), media failure and incomplete/past drafts. The adapter is not selected by `getSchedulerAdapter()` and its mutation shape is unverified live, so no success is claimed. OAuth, storage, worker jobs and live acceptance remain blocked on owner access.

- Date: 2026-10-27
  Decision: Build Google review sync against a stubbed client interface while API access is pending (#46)
  Why: Approval can take weeks, and the storage, encryption, checkpoint, retry and revoke logic is provider-independent. `liveClient()` throws until access exists, so nothing can call Google or be mistaken for a live integration. Uses Node crypto (AES-256-GCM) and no new dependency; #46 stays open until the live acceptance test in integrations.md passes.
