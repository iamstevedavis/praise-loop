# PraiseLoop

Turns existing customer reviews into ready-to-post social media content for local
businesses: deterministic quote selection, AI captions in the brand voice, branded
image rendering, and a human-in-the-loop approval queue.

PraiseLoop is moving to a phone app for owners, backed by this server: see the
[mobile-first plan](docs/mobile-plan.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and npm 10+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- Docker with the Compose plugin (runs Postgres and Redis containers); the
  all-containers dev override needs Compose 2.24.4+ (`docker compose version`)

## Quickstart — host + containers (recommended for development)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm ci
docker compose up -d postgres redis
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:health
npm run dev        # web on http://localhost:3000
npm run worker     # in another terminal: draft generation loop
```

Before customer access, configure owner sign-in and claim any legacy data as
described in [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md).

All-containers workflows, configuration, tests and deployment:
[docs/development.md](docs/development.md).

## Current limitations

- Reviews come from manual CSV import; Google review sync is blocked on provider
  access ([integrations](docs/integrations.md)).
- Real publishing isn't configured; scheduling fails closed
  ([integrations](docs/integrations.md)). The mobile plan replaces it with the
  phone's share sheet for the MVP.
- Owner sign-in needs Google OAuth configuration (#78).
