# Sample data

The one folder for example data that isn't code: files you can upload by hand,
templates for the pilot, and the inputs the dev seeder and tests read.

- `csv/` holds review exports you can upload through the app's CSV import, one
  file per business or business type, named after the business
  (`<business-name>.csv`).
- `pilot/` holds the synthetic pilot ledger used as a template in
  [docs/pilot.md](../docs/pilot.md) and read by `scripts/test-pilot.ts`.

`npm run dev:seed` loads every file in `csv/` that it lists in
`scripts/seed/fixtures.ts` through the real CSV import, so the drafts it creates
quote these reviews. If you change a review there, check the seeded drafts that
quote it. See [docs/development.md](../docs/development.md#demo-flow-with-synthetic-data).

**Everything here is invented.** The reviews and reviewer names are fictional and
only exist to exercise the app. Never publish a post made from sample reviews,
and never mix real customer reviews into these files. Real reviews belong in the
owner's own import, not in the repository.

## CSV format

Required columns: `rating` (1-5), `text`, `reviewed_at` (ISO 8601). Optional:
`author_name`, `source_review_id`, `source_url`. The sample files fill
`source_review_id` with a `sample-<business>-NNN` id so a re-import is
recognised as duplicates instead of adding rows. Limits: 1 MB, 1000 rows; see
[docs/features.md](../docs/features.md#csv-review-import).

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `csv/hespeler-powder-coating.csv` | Hespeler Powder Coating, Cambridge, ON: sandblasting, powder coating and machine shop (24 reviews, ratings 2-5) |
| `csv/copper-kettle-cafe.csv` | Copper Kettle Café, an invented neighbourhood café (21 reviews, ratings 1-5, `sample-cafe-NNN`) |
| `csv/harbour-bike-repair.csv` | Harbour Bike Repair, an invented bike shop (17 reviews, ratings 2-5, `sample-bike-NNN`) |
| `pilot/pilot-synthetic.json` | Example pilot ledger entries for synthetic businesses |

The "download a sample" file in the app's onboarding is separate on purpose:
`public/onboarding-example.csv` is served by the web app, so it has to stay under
`public/`.
